 To run emotion script, run:

	video_server.py (This folder)
	lidar_detect_crowd (Mobility base folder)
	par_recognise_person (This folder)
Video server handles requests to access the emotions
Detect crowd passes in the number of people around based on the lidar code
Recognise person handles both of those and calls the correct vid based on the num of people
